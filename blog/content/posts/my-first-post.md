### Welcome 
Welcome to the internal COXIT blog about Prompt Engeneering and LLM integrations.

This is COXIT's internal R&D project. We aim to investigate different tools, approaches, and prompt engineering techniques for building LLM-powered production-ready solutions. We aim to try different tools currently known on the market and define what works and what causes any problems for our specific use cases.

As a result of this project, we will build a knowledge base describing which of the available LLM evaluation tools, frameworks, LLMs themselves, and prompt engineering techniques worked best for our specific LLM-related cases, explain what didn't work, and why.


To make a new post, install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), then run:
```bash
cd blog
hugo mod get -u # fetch the theme module
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md #adjust filename to match title of your post
hugo server -D
```

### Tech Stack

This blog is powered by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + github actions + github pages. 

Pages are simple markdown, so github preview functionality is sufficient.

My favorite features of this setup:
- static, secure autogenerated without any infra outside of github repo
- the client-side [search](/search/) (see [index.json](/index.json)) powered by [fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/).
- single binary to download to edit on local computer
- Option to avoid installing hugo locally and just create+edit pages via edit-on-github UX.
- Markdown

Cons:
- Using github auth prevents rss :(
