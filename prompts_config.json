    "CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS": "\r\nNote: \r\n-  Treat Thermally Fused Melamine (TFM), Thermally Fused Laminate (TFL), and Color Matching Thermofused as the same. \r\n-  If Thermally Fused Melamine is specified as a prefabricated particleboard, select only TFL and don't look for other indicators.\r\n-  Do not take into account the Concealed Cabinet Materials.\r\n-  Plastic Laminate and HPL are not the same.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. Start with Material Requirements:\r\n   - Begin with the section detailing material requirements.\r\n\r\n2. Core Material Selection:\r\n   - Search for the specified core material.\r\n   - If mentions that adhesives can't contain urea formaldehyde, pick NAUF; otherwise, select IPB CARB Compliant.\r\n   - If not explicitly stated, default to Industrial Particleboard CARB Compliant.\r\n   - Keywords for alternative materials: NAUF, No Added Urea Formaldehyde, MDF, Plywood, Hardwood, Plycore.\r\n   - If adhesives with urea formaldehyde are prohibited, select No Added Urea Formaldehyde Particleboard (NAUF PB Core).\r\n   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected core material.\r\n\r\n3. Fronts Material Selection:\r\n   - Identify materials specified for finished fronts (exposed surfaces).\r\n   - If fronts are not specified, default to HPL unless TFL or A-Tech Surface is mentioned.\r\n   - If Thermally Fused Melamine is specified as a prefabricated particleboard, select TFL.\r\n   - If color matching to interiors/exteriors is required, select TFL.\r\n   - If both HPL and TFL can be used, choose TFL as the more cost-effective option.\r\n   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected fronts material.\r\n\r\n4. Fronts Thickness Determination:\r\n   - Identify the specified thickness for fronts.\r\n   - If not specified, use the standard thickness for the selected material.\r\n   - Eliminate any options that do not match the specified or standard thickness.\r\n\r\n5. Ends Material Selection:\r\n   - Search for specified materials for finished ends (exposed surfaces).\r\n   - If ends are not specified, default to the same as fronts material.\r\n   - If color matching to interiors/exteriors is required, select TFL.\r\n   - If both HPL and TFL can be used, choose TFL as the more cost-effective option.\r\n   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected ends material.\r\n\r\n6. Fronts Edging Selection:\r\n   - Identify the specified edging for fronts (doors and drawer fronts).\r\n   - If solid PVC edging or .020\" thickness is mentioned, select Square Flat Edge.\r\n   - If 3 mm thickness is specified for doors/drawer fronts, choose 3 mm Radius Edging Style.\r\n   - If no edging is specified, default to Square Flat Edge.\r\n   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected edging style.\r\n\r\n7. Cabinet Edgebanding Selection:\r\n   - Search for the specified cabinet edgebanding.\r\n   - If not specified, default to Flat (.020\") PVC Cabinet Edgebanding.\r\n   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected cabinet edgebanding style.\r\n\r\n8. Final Review:\r\n   - Ensure all selections are compatible with each other.\r\n   - Verify that all requirements from the original specification have been addressed.\r\n   - If any conflicts or ambiguities remain, note them for further clarification.",
