Steps:

1. Start with Material Requirements:
   - Begin with the section detailing material requirements.

2. Core Material Selection:
   - Search for the specified core material.
   - If mentions that adhesives can't contain urea formaldehyde, pick NAUF; otherwise, select IPB CARB Compliant.
   - If not explicitly stated, default to Industrial Particleboard CARB Compliant.

   - If Thermally Fused Melamine is specified as a prefabricated particleboard, select TFL.
   - If color matching to interiors/exteriors is required, select TFL.
   - If both HPL and TFL can be used, choose TFL as the more cost-effective option.
   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected fronts material.

4. Fronts Thickness Determination:
   - Identify the specified thickness for fronts.
   - If not specified, use the standard thickness for the selected material.
   - Eliminate any options that do not match the specified or standard thickness.

5. Ends Material Selection:
   - Search for specified materials for finished ends (exposed surfaces).
   - If ends are not specified, default to the same as fronts material.
   - If color matching to interiors/exteriors is required, select TFL.
   - If both HPL and TFL can be used, choose TFL as the more cost-effective option.
   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected ends material.

6. Fronts Edging Selection:
   - Identify the specified edging for fronts (doors and drawer fronts).
   - If solid PVC edging or .020"" thickness is mentioned, select Square Flat Edge.
   - If 3 mm thickness is specified for doors/drawer fronts, choose 3 mm Radius Edging Style.
   - If no edging is specified, default to Square Flat Edge.
   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected edging style.

7. Cabinet Edgebanding Selection:
   - Search for the specified cabinet edgebanding.
   - If not specified, default to Flat (.020"") PVC Cabinet Edgebanding.
   - Eliminate any options that do not match the selected cabinet edgebanding style.

8. Final Review:
   - Ensure all selections are compatible with each other.
   - Verify that all requirements from the original specification have been addressed.
   - If any conflicts or ambiguities remain, note them for further clarification."
